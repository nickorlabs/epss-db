# Explore and Implement Multi-Source Exploit Integration (Addresses Issue #16)

This PR addresses Issue #16 ("Link with PoC information") by exploring and implementing comprehensive exploit data integration from multiple vulnerability intelligence sources.

## Overview
The goal is to enhance EPSS-DB by linking EPSS scores with actual exploit availability information, helping users prioritize vulnerabilities that have known public exploits in the wild.

## Data Sources Being Explored

### Primary Sources (Phase 1)
- **ExploitDB**: 
  - Exploring both direct database access and searchsploit tool integration
  - Evaluating JSON/CSV data feeds vs. API options
  - Goal: Complete repository data accessible directly from our database

- **GitHub Exploit Repositories**: 
  - Evaluating multiple approaches: PoC-in-GitHub API, direct GitHub API, and specialized CVE exploit aggregators
  - Considering rate limiting, completeness, and data freshness tradeoffs

- **Metasploit Framework modules**:
  - Investigating both GitHub repo parsing and potential API access
  - Need to determine best approach for regular updates

- **Packet Storm Security**:
  - Assessing data acquisition methods (web scraping vs. available data feeds)
  - Exploring parsing strategies for their exploit and advisory content

- **Nuclei Vulnerability Templates**:
  - Exploring direct template parsing vs. any available APIs
  - Will determine most efficient approach

- **KEV Catalog**:
  - Already implemented, will integrate with the new exploit database

### Phase 2 Sources
- **AttackerKB**: Community vulnerability assessments
- **OSV database**: Open Source Vulnerabilities
- **GrayNoise**: In-the-wild exploitation intelligence

### Extended Sources (Phase 3)
- Vendor-specific advisories (Microsoft, Apache, etc.)
- Additional intelligence sources as identified

## Implementation Approach

This PR starts with a planning and exploration phase:
1. Determine optimal data access methods for each source
2. Design flexible database schema to accommodate all sources
3. Create modular framework for source-specific fetchers
4. Implement sources incrementally, starting with the most valuable/accessible

## Current Status
This PR currently contains planning documentation. I'm seeking input on the best approaches for each data source before implementation.

## Comments Welcome On:
- Additional exploit sources to consider
- Preferred data access methods for each source
- Integration priorities
