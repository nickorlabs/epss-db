## Implementing Exploit Data Integration

I'm planning to work on this issue to add exploit information from multiple sources to EPSS-DB.

### Key Exploit Sources

**Initial Implementation:**
- Metasploit Framework modules
- ExploitDB repository (using searchsploit tool: `searchsploit --cve CVE-ID`)
- Nuclei vulnerability templates
- GitHub exploit code repositories (via PoC-in-GitHub API: https://poc-in-github.motikan2010.net/)
- KEV Catalog (already implemented)

**Future Additions:**
- GrayNoise intelligence
- AttackerKB
- Packet Storm
- OSV database
- Vendor advisories

### Implementation Plan

I'll create:
1. Database tables for storing exploit data (main table + metadata + tags)
2. Individual update scripts for each source
3. Main coordinator script that updates all exploit sources
4. SQL queries to join EPSS scores with exploit data

This will let users identify which vulnerabilities have public exploits and correlate exploit availability with EPSS scores.

I'll start with ExploitDB integration in a new branch and will share progress soon.
